Romble-server
=============

Romble-server is the server-side implementation of the **Romble** project.

# Romble
Romble is a content delivery platform for classic video game consoles (such as NES, SNES, Genesis, etc.). Romble uses the USB developer port available on many popular flash cartridges (such as the Mega Everdrive) to interface with your Internet-connected PC, enabling delivery of public domain ROMs direct from the Web to your console.

## What is Romble made up of?
The complete Romble platform includes the server side application providing a REST API for storage and delivery of game ROMs (romble-server), Web service providing access to the official Romble Public Domain Repository (romble-web), Client-side PC application to interface with your favourite console (romble-pc), and the various console clients which interface with the rest of the platform (romble-gen, romble-nes, romble-snes, etc).

## May I contribute?
It's on Github, ain't it? Simply submit a pull request. Romble is a cool project to add to your resume.

## Is Romble designed to perpetuate piracy?
No! The official Romble Public Domain Repository only provides public domain ROMs created by talented homebrew developers who enjoy working on classic consoles.

## But what about third-party Romble servers?
The license expressly forbids usage of any Romble component for piracy (see below).

## What is this software licensed under?
BSD 3-Clause License, with the addition that this software not be used for piracy.
